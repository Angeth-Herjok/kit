## Adaptor Docs Example

Test harness and example for the adaptor-docs repo.

Start the dev server with 

```
pnpm start
```

The dev server has a simple auto-reload and will automatically watch for changes.

Remember to watch the build in packags/adaptor-docs to make changes reflect straight into the running example.
