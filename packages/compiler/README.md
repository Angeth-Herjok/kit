## @openfn/compiler

Functions and utilities to compile and analyse code.

The primary job of the compiler right now is to take job DSL code and convert it into JS which can be executed by the runtime.

## Expected functionality

* Build an AST for some JS (and openfn JS DSL)
* Transpile a JS-DSL into job-compatible JS
* Report errors and warnings on job/js code (custom linting stuff)
* (maybe) Generate a form UI tree and convert a form UI tree back to JS
