# Diagrams

Diagrams are created using [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/).

Editing diagrams can be done in the browser via the Draw.io web app, however
in order to programmically export the files to SVG for use in markdown
it is suggested to install the desktop version.

See [here](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop/releases) to get the 
appropriate version for your OS.

## Exporting to SVG

1. Install draw.io
2. Export the diagram to SVG:  
   `drawio --export <filename> --format svg`
